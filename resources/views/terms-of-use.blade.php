<p>COOKIES AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE AUTOMATICALLY COLLECT</p>
<p>Like most platforms, CLACH logs IP addresses and uses cookies and similar technologies that allow us to recognize you and to customize your experience, and provide us with information about the way our visitors access our Platform. You can find out more about how we use cookies and related technologies below.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is a cookie?</em></strong></p>
<p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. They are used to recognise your computer as you move between pages on a website, or when you return to a website or mobile application you have visited previously. Cookies are widely used in order to make platforms work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the platform.</p>
<p>We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering your language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our Platform is used. Cookies will tell us, for example, whether you have visited our Platform before or whether you are a new visitor. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First party cookies,&nbsp;</strong>served directly by CLACH to your computer or mobile device. They are used only by CLACH to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Platform.</li>
<li><strong>Third party cookies,&nbsp;</strong>which are served by a third party service provider on our Platform, and can be used by the service provider to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other platforms. Third party cookies are most commonly used for platform analytics or advertising purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. CLACH uses both ‘session cookies’ and ‘permanent cookies’. Session cookies exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Permanent cookies survive after your browser is closed, and can be used to recognize your computer or mobile device when you open your browser and browse the internet again.</p>
<p><strong><em>What cookies does CLACH</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>use?</em></strong></p>
<p>The Platform serves only the following types of cookies to your computer or mobile device:</p>
